# **User Dashboard Project**

This project is a simple user dashboard built with **React** and **TypeScript** that allows users to filter and sort a list of users fetched from a REST API.

## **Technologies**

- **React**: For building the UI with a component-based architecture.
- **TypeScript**: For static typing and improved code quality.
- **SWR**: For data fetching, chosen due to its caching, background revalidation, and automatic error handling.
- **Sass (SCSS)**: For modular and maintainable styling with features like nesting and variables.
